# Minjoo (Mia) Sung â€“ Fraud & Risk Analyst | Trust & Safety | Detection Strategy

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm Minjoo (Mia) Sung â€” a fraud and risk analyst with 5+ years of experience across traditional banking, fintech startups, and the intersection of fraud prevention, compliance, and detection logic design. I combine domain expertise with hands-on data tools to help organizations reduce risk, improve reviewer efficiency, and build scalable, explainable detection systems.

## ðŸ§  About Me

I believe effective fraud and risk analytics require more than just flagging anomalies â€” they demand context-driven rule logic, operational alignment, and smart prioritization of alerts that real users can act on. My experience reflects this philosophy:

- **At ProBit Global**, a fast-paced crypto exchange, I led the design and tuning of real-time fraud detection rules using GTONE and Chainalysis. I collaborated with engineers to reduce false positives by 30% and align alert triggers with abuse patterns.
- **At HSBC and SMBC**, I performed CDD reviews, transaction monitoring, and AML screening using LexisNexis, World-Check, and SWIFT, supporting institutional onboarding and regulatory compliance.
- **At Bank of Communications**, I built dashboards to monitor deposit risk and performed behavioral analysis to support retention and reporting.
- **At USC**, I completed a fraud detection capstone project using Python (LightGBM), focusing on behavior-based feature engineering, rule validation, and alert precision â€” simulating a real-world detection workflow rather than purely academic modeling.

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission

> "Fraud prevention isn't just about stopping bad actors â€” it's about building trust and resilience into the system itself."

I view my work as bridging risk detection and operational clarity. Whether it's tuning velocity-based rules, reducing alert fatigue, or designing explainable detection logic, my focus is on enabling scalable risk mitigation that supports both users and reviewers.
