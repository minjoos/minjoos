# Minjoo (Mia) Sung â€“ Fraud, Risk & Data Analyst

## ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm Minjoo (Mia) Sung â€” a data-driven analyst with 5+ years of experience spanning traditional banking, fintech startups, and the intersection of fraud prevention, risk management, and data analytics. With a foundation in Economics from UC Berkeley and a Masterâ€™s in Business Analytics (STEM) from USC Marshall, I bring a unique blend of domain expertise, data literacy, and operational awareness to solving some of the most pressing challenges in financial services.

## ðŸ§  About Me

I believe that effective fraud and risk analytics go beyond just flagging anomalies. They require thoughtful design, contextual understanding, cross-functional collaboration, and scalable systems. My professional journey reflects this perspective:

- At **HSBC** and **SMBC**, I developed a deep understanding of AML/KYC regulations, filing SARs, onboarding institutional clients, and screening profiles against sanctions/PEP lists using tools like LexisNexis, RDC, and World-Check.
- At **Bank of Communications**, I worked on deposit risk metrics, created dashboards using Power BI, and performed trend analysis to support client retention and regulatory reporting.
- At **ProBit Global**, a fast-paced crypto exchange, I led the implementation of real-time fraud detection systems using GTONE and Chainalysis, collaborated with engineers to tune detection logic, and reduced false positives by 30%.
- As a graduate student at **USC**, I focused on ML-based fraud detection projects, including a credit card fraud model using LightGBM that achieved 87% precision for the top 3% riskiest transactions, resulting in a projected $40M+ in annual savings.

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission

> "Preventing fraud isnâ€™t just about catching bad actors â€” itâ€™s about enabling trust, transparency, and resilience in every transaction."

I view my work as sitting at the intersection of analytics and integrity. Whether building fraud models, tuning detection rules, automating KYC workflows, or supporting audits, my goal is to contribute to safer financial ecosystems through data and thoughtful systems.

Iâ€™m especially motivated by roles that involve:
- **Fraud strategy and risk modeling**
- **Transaction monitoring optimization**
- **Compliance automation using data science**
- **Cross-functional analytics across risk, operations, and engineering**

## ðŸ§© Projects & Use Cases

### ðŸ”¹ Credit Card Fraud Detection (USC MSBA Capstone)
Developed a LightGBM model trained on over 100,000 transactions to detect fraud in real-time.  
- Precision: 57% for top 3% most risky transactions  
- Potential savings: $40M+ annually  
- Engineered time-window features and tuned hyperparameters for imbalanced data

### ðŸ”¹ Application Fraud Rule Optimization (ProBit Global)
Led the design and tuning of real-time fraud rules using GTONE; identified redundant thresholds and optimized flag logic.  
- False positive rate reduced by 30%  
- Aligned rulebook logic with transaction trends

### ðŸ”¹ AML Screening & Client Risk Review (HSBC)
Screened institutional clients monthly, assessed risk ratings, and prepared audit-ready documentation.  
- Handled 150+ profiles/month  
- Collaborated with internal UAT teams to test KYC system upgrades
